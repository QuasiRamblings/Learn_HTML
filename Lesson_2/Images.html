		<h1>This is how to use HTML for images</h1>

		<p>Insert images into HTML using the img tag with a source attribute src</p>
		
		<p>Best practice is to always include 'alt' tag within element - it's used to describe the image for the visually impaired for screen readers</P>
		
		<p>Important to know how big your image is to be able to add attributes for height and width in text of pixels, i.e. 500x375</p>
		
		<p>Open the image, then right click on it, select file info, and look for the dimensions</p>
		
		<img src="images/carrots.jpg" alt="Picture of carrots just taken out of the ground" width="500" height="375">
		
		<p>Block-level elements will take up the entire width of the page</p>
		
		<p>In-line elements will only take up as much space as it's widdth </p>
		
		<p>Paragraph tags are Block-level elements and take up the entire width, so nothing will go next to it</p>
		
		<img src="images/kale.jpg" alt="Picture of carrots just taken out of the ground" width="320" height="239">
